//deadline. 1 week.
//what is it built with? vs studio code. probably with a let ranNum = math.random()* maxNum. then maybe an array with nested arrays. and then it uses a for 
//loop to log everything untill i is = array[ranNum][i].length.

//what can it do? (before hint.) return a random fact. the fact is an array. it has 2 spaces. first space is a number. second space is the fact. The fact starts with a 
//: then after that it has a space followed by the fact. since the program requires 3 different pieces of data. object (array) is one. 
//the second is a number at the beginning of the fact. the third is the string.

//2.
//what can it do? (checked hint.) it said just 3 different pieces of data. not 3 different data types. this makes it more fun.
//what can it do? return a random videogame. first the name. then the genre and console, then the metacritic score. it can recommend videogames for people. so it just outputs random good 
//games that has a rating of at least 8.5. so its a quality rnadom game generator.
