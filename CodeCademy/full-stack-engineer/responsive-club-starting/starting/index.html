            <h2>Our brand new concept. Open now in the basement below our mechanic garage "Brians garage".</h2>
            <p>Some people miss a club where they can go train with likeminded people. So in order to help those poeple we have started brians gym. 
                Come and meet likeminded people that train the benchpress and the bicep curl every single day and nothing else. 
                Because leg day is overrated. We all walk every day after all.</p>

                    <p>Since joining brians gym i have felt better than ever. Instead of beating my wife i try beat my personal bench press record. 
                        Also after having taking the chemical oatmeal i have seen huge differences. I dont know whats in it though.</p>

                    <p>Being able to meet with likeminded people and train the benchpress has been fantastic for me. Even if my arms or chest havent grown i have instead grown as a person.</p>
