    <!-- 
        burde vise billeder af de forskellige teknologier jeg kunne endten i starten eller slutningen. bl.a. chrome dev tools. sql, css, html, javscirpt, git, github.  command line,
        C#, maybe visual studio code. maybe a little blender. though maybe best to exclude. maybe node though i think best to exclude for now. maybe also include a little power bi on the site.

        also apart form that maybe a good idea to have a picture of me. could be me staring towards some of the things i think i might be good at or the things i have made.
        maybe mention the sql powerpoints. maybe mention brians gym or brians garage. maybe showcase javsacript method library. those are 3 different things or maybe the C#
        roulette game. maybe change it to english instead of danish. So its more readable for recruiters. Though not sure. those are 4 projects im pretty proud of. maybe also include the
        power bi project.
        
        maybe impliment a dark mode with javacsript. if not a counter to see how long i have been programming. 1 month max. 
        
        maybe add a description of me as a person short. And for how long i have been programming. maybe also add human languages and write. english, danish fluently and a ittle german. 
        those could be in a list of pointers with round circles.
        maybe also add the projects as links to where they are.

        Maybe add a seperate site that has all of my projects listed in order. Maybe the old design could be implemented for this. with miwers suggestion with proejcts as buttons.
        maybe those projects could have an img as the background for the button. then they could be used on the new site to reuse the code and make it simpler.

        maybe also add a contact page. so 3 pages maybe. projects. about me, and contact. unsure if a fourth one should be added
        
        deadline done by december 19. max.

        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello. I'm a 22 year old programmer based in Copenhagen Denmark. I'm interested in learning different technologies that create value for users.</p>
        <p>I have made a couple of websites with HTML, CSS and javascript. I have also tried analyzing and organizing datasets with SQL and made applications in C#.</p>
        <p>I like to learn different things so i have dabbeled a little in power BI to try and visualize SQL data. I have also tried using blender a little to try out 3D modelling</p>
